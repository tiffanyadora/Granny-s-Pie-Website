        I chose to keep the header simple with just two lines because I wanted it to be direct and be easy to read.
        I made the heartfelt tagline to make it feel more personal, like you're visiting your own grandmother's house.
        For accessibility, I made sure to use proper heading levels so screen reader users can easily navigate the page structure.

        The layout of "Our story" section was quite challenging since I wanted the story image on the left side next to the text. 
        I decided to use display 'flex' since it provides an easy way to control layout and spacing.
        This also helps with responsiveness - on mobile, I can easily stack the image above text by using media queries.

                <p>Since 1952, Granny's Pies has been serving up slices of happiness using time-tested family recipes and the finest ingredients.
                    It all began when Granny Rose Thompson started baking pies from her home kitchen in downtown Nashville and sharing her creations with neighbors and friends.
                    What started as a humble small business, with Rose selling pies from her front porch, quickly became the talk of the town.
                    Her secret? <strong>A blend of patience, good ol' ingredients, and the belief that every pie should be baked with love.</strong>

            I set up the recipe grid to be responsive because I wanted it to work well on phones and tablets.
            Each recipe card has a clear structure with the image, title, brief description, and link.
            I made sure to add descriptive alt text for each pie photo that mentions the key visual features - 
            like the "toasted fluffy meringue peaks" for the lemon pie. 
            This helps screen reader users understand what the pie looks like & their speciality.
            The other pie recipes are only placeholders; the only working link is the Lemon Meringue Pie one.
