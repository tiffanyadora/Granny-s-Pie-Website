/* recipe.css is the main styling for the Recipe page. The styling & color scheme was used to match the given appearance 
   requirements. The Serif font (Cambria) was chosen to improve readability for longer text passages, while all of the 
   headings used a Sans serif font called Trebuchet MS to make it pop.
   Heading styles (H1, H2) create clear visual hierarchy while maintaining consistency across the page.
   The background color in the headings will provide subtle emphasis without being distracting.
